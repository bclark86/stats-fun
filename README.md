# Applied Statistics

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), statistics is
a branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, organization,
analysis, interpretation and presentation. It is often using a sample of
data to make inferences about a population.

The goal of these mini-projects is to apply various statistical concepts
to real-world data to answer questions through experimentation.
